## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Elise Thompson

## About Me!

### Hobbies/Interests
I love to read and garden. I especially enjoy reading about gardening. I love to learn about anything and everything, but math is my favorite subject.

### Education
I'm currently a rising junior at The Bryn Mawr School.

### Professional Experiences
I have none. ðŸ˜ž But I most definitely have a liftetime of work ahead of me!

### Career Goals
I aspire to be an agricultural engineer. Gardening is truly one of my favorite things to do, but I like math and science too much to just be a farmer. I want to develop technology to enhance plant growth so that more people can have access to fresh food. Quite honestly, I'm not entirely sure what agriculture engineers do on a day-to-day basis, but I like the way the title sounds. ðŸ™‚
